# Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree solution using a tree structure (as opposed to an array).

# Time Complexity
Contains: O(log n)
<br/>Add: O(log n)
<br/>Delete: O(log n)

The time complexity depends on how well balanced the tree is. In the worst case scenerio each of these operations will be O(n).

# Space Complexity
O(n)


## Output
In-Order Test: PASSED
<br/>Pre-Order Test: PASSED
<br/>Post-Order Test: PASSED
<br/>Level-Order Test: PASSED
<br/>Contains Test: PASSED
<br/>Deletion Test: PASSED
