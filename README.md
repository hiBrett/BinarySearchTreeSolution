# Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree solution using a tree structure (as opposed to an array).

# Time Complexity
Contains: O(log n)
Add: O(log n)
Delete: O(log n)

In the worst case scenerio each of these will be O(n). This only happens when the items are inserted in an order that causes the tree to look like a list.


## Output
In-Order Test: PASSED
<br/>Pre-Order Test: PASSED
<br/>Post-Order Test: PASSED
<br/>Level-Order Test: PASSED
<br/>Contains Test: PASSED
<br/>Deletion Test: PASSED
